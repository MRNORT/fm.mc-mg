# CadenceRadio

**Cadence** is a web radio API server. It connects open-source stream software _Icecast_ and a _Postgres_ database, allowing radio administrators to broadcast music from the filesystem to the internet while allowing users to search for music and make song requests through a custom web frontend.

In the current iteration (4.x) of Cadence, no frontend framework is employed and the backend is written in Go. For questions and comments, you are welcome to [open a discussion](https://github.com/kenellorando/cadence/discussions) on Github.

Check it out in action: [https://cadenceradio.com/](https://cadenceradio.com/).

## Discord Bot

_CadenceBot_, maintained by [Ryan Hodin](https://github.com/za419), is an configurable Discord interface to Cadence API servers. The bot accepts commands through Discord text channels, and relays music into voice channels!
