# CadenceRadio

**Cadence** is a web radio API server. It prepares and communicates data between independent stream software _Icecast_, audio client _Liquidsoap_, and a _Postgres_ database, allowing radio administrators to broadcast audio on the filesystem to the internet while allowing users to search for music and make song requests through a custom web frontend.

In the current iteration (4.x) of Cadence, no frontend framework is employed and the backend is written in Go. For questions and comments, you are welcome to [open a discussion](https://github.com/kenellorando/cadence/discussions) on Github.
