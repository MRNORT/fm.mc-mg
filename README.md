# CadenceRadio

**Cadence** is an all-in-one suite that lets you start a self-hosted web radio website.

In minutes, create an internet broadcast with library search, song request, album artwork, and real-time stream information in a browser UI. All components are mostly pre-configured to work out-of-the-box. Simply run an interactive installation script and deploy!

## üèÉ Start Here

### Requirements
You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### Installation
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

You will be prompted for a music directory path, a stream hostname, a rate limit timeout, a service password, and optional DNS. After the last prompt, the radio stack will automatically launch and Cadence's web UI will become accessible at `localhost:8080`. 

After initial installation, simply run `docker compose up` to start your station. Use `install.sh` again at any time to reconfigure inputs.
