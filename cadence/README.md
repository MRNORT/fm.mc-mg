# CadenceRadio

**Cadence** is an API server for stream software _Icecast_ and audio client _Liquidsoap_. It allows you to broadcast audio on the filesystem to the internet while allowing users to search for music and make song requests through a browser frontend.

For questions and comments, you are welcome to [open a discussion](https://github.com/kenellorando/cadence/discussions) on Github.
